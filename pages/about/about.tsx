        After graduating from a design school, I was looking for a way to build
        my online portfolio. My passion to be creative with my portfolio was
        ambitious, but it did not seem that my creativity was being respected by
        existing no-code website builders, and this led me to{" "}
        <span className="brightness-150 text-white">explore coding</span>. Since
        then, I&#39;ve worked on various side projects, from NFTs to social
        services for non-profits.
      </p>

        Currently, I focus on designing and building{" "}
        <span className="brightness-150 text-white">
          accessible user interfaces
        </span>
        for vulnerable communities. I especially enjoy the intersection of
        design and development.{" "}

        Outside of work, I enjoy running and dancing to stay resilient.
        Occasionally, I take on{" "}

          new design projects
        </a>
        or focus on coding at a local caf√©.
