      <p>
        I&#39;m a Product and Web Designer passionate about creating intuitive
        and impactful digital experiences. To enhance my design skills, I
        learned web development and now work with tools like TypeScript, React,
        and Node.js. Ever since 2022, I have been carrying side projects in
        development to continue my growth and bridge the gap between design and
        functionality. Today, I am capable of full-stack development and am
        contributing to a project called OperateEase as a Web Developer as well.
